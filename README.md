# HashTable

## Introduction

This is a repository for my hashtable. 

## How to use

Firstly you should copy mu repository to your computer, using "For Usage". Then you should add a text file(it should start with no letter) where you want to count words with hashtable(i added Hamlet.txt for example). Then you can write in main.cpp the word you are looking for and the program will cound how many times this word meeted in the textfile. To make it more convenient i created Makefile.

For usage:

```
git clone https://github.com/kefirRzevo/HashTable.git
cd HashTable
make
```
